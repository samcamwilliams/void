void
====

A simple personal note/thought storage and retrieval system, with no security.

## Usage ##

Execute `void.sh` to add a note to the database and `dvoid.sh` to retrieve them. I `void.sh` bound to open in a terminal when I press a certain key combination for ease of use.

`dvoid.sh` will (currently) allow you to search the database, view stats, view the whole database and random entries.

## Future Work ##

* Encryption.
* Better storage mechanism (possibly mnesia).
* More advanced searching support.
